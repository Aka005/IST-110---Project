                  <p>I downloaded Microsoft 365, Adobe Acrobat Pro, and Adobe Express from the Penn State IT software download page.</p>
                  <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This was a quick task for me because I already had Microsoft 365 and Adobe Express installed. The one new thing I learned was that Adobe Acrobat Pro is included in the Creative Cloud. It also made me appreciate how many useful tools I have access to through Penn State.

                  <p>I completed tutorials on ChatGPT, explored prompt engineering, and created my own example using the CREATE framework.</p>
                  <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> I learned how to write more focused prompts that help AI more useful responses. Using the CREATE framework helped me understand how to break down complex questions into simpler parts. I know now how to be more intentional when interacting with AI tools.

                     <li>L03: Creating an Infographic</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>I used Adobe Express to design an infographic that explained how to solve technical problems using ChatGPT.</p>
                  <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> I learned how to visually communicate information in an engaging way. I learned how to guide ChatGPT to generate helpful content that I could then turn into a visual resource. It showed me how powerful AI can be in supporting both technical and creative tasks.</p>

                     <li>L03: 3D Printing</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>I printed a Nittany Lion figure with 3DPrinterOS and had the option to either personalize it or choose another object. I picked up the final print from the Media Commons at Paterno.</p>
                  <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> I found it fun getting a physical object from my classwork. Compared to my past experience with AutoCAD, 3DPrinterOS felt more user-friendly and accessible. I learned how digital designs are converted into real objects, although I wish the process for customizing items had been explained more clearly.

                     <li>L04: Hardware Dissection Lab</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>I explored the Nintendo Switch OLED, identifying internal components. After that, I created a PowerPoint presentation that presented my findings.</p>
                  <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> I was surprised by how complex such a small device could be. I learned about the inner components, such as the I/O devices and memory, and how they all work together. This made me curious about how technology products are designed.

                     <li>L05: Letter to an OS</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>I wrote a breakup letter to LinkedIn. My goal was to make it playful and funny.</p>
                  <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> My classmates gave me feedback that LinkedIn is technically not an OS, which made me think about how crucial accuracy is. This made me interested in how technology products are created. Despite that, I enjoyed being able to express my own experiences in a creative way. This not only made the process more enjoyable but also allowed me to experiment with AI in writing.</p>

                     <li>L06: Intro to GENAI - Part 2</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p> I used AI tools like Copilot, ChatGPT, and Perplexity to build troubleshooting guides using the CREATE framework.</p>
                  <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> It was interesting to see how each AI tool offered slightly different outputs, even with the same prompt. I learned that the tone and format of answers can vary depending on what tool one uses. This made me more aware about which AI to use depending on the kind of answer I need.</p>

                     <li>L06: Python Programming</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>I picked up on fundamental Python programming from Grok Academy, e.g., how to implement a simple rating system using input() and int().</p>
                  <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> As I had worked with Java before, Python was very familiar at first. But it took a while to adjust to its indentation rules and simplicity. This made me appreciate again how important it is to grasp the basics even when the language is simple at first. I liked that Grok Academy let me learn at my own pace, which was very convenient.</p>

                     <li>L09: HTML</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>I created a basic personal webpage using HTML components such as headers, paragraphs, images, and links.</p>
                  <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> I loved this as a refresher because I already knew full-stack web development from a previous course. I found it fun to go through the basics again and re-learn how HTML provides structure to a webpage. I learned how to write clean code that can make a website not only functional, but also meaningful.</p>
