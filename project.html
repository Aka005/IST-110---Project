                  <p>I clarified what site I would use to create my portfolio and chose GitHub because I enjoy coding and have experience using it for other classes.
</em></p>
                  <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> I learned how important it is to plan ahead when using technical tools like GitHub for portfolio purposes. I learned how to apply my previous experience with coding to build a more organized platform. I also learned how portfolios can reflect both technical and creative skills.

                  <li>L05: Learning Portfolio Milestone 1</li>
                  <p>I had to put together a draft on GitHub. This draft needed to show everything we did in class, like individual assignments, group assignments, discussions, and projects.
</p>
                  <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> At first, I didn't check all the required assignments. This mistake taught me that reviewing the requirements carefully is very important. Transferring my work from Visual Studio Code to GitHub was a bit challenging at first. But after trying different ways, I got better at it. I learned that adding clear reflections helps not only me but also others who look at it.

                  <li>L12: Portfolio Coaching Milestone 2</li>
                  <p>I created a website from scratch by using my frontend development skills. This website is a place where I display my assignments from IST 110. I then posted it on Kritik to gather feedback from my peers.</p>
                  <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Feedback from my classmates were new perspectives that I hadn't thought about before. This experience taught me that organizing content in a way that's easy to follow really improves how others interact with my work. I also realized how important it is to have a good visual design and easy navigation to communicate information effectively through a portfolio.

                  <li>L13: Learning Portfolio Milestones 3</li>
                  <p>I used feedback from students on Kritik to improve my portfolio. My goal was to make it more organized and visually appealing. 
</p>
                  <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> In my final project, I discovered something useful. By breaking my portfolio into several pages, it became much easier for people to navigate compared to just having one long page. Also, sharing full links to my assignments, instead of just small images, made it simpler for everyone to access and understand them. Through this experience, I learned how crucial it is to keep information clear and easy to find.</p>
