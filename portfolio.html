<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi everyone! My name is Emily Jao. I'm a sophomore majoring in Cybersecurity with an IST minor. I took this class to deepen my understanding of information science and technology.</p>

<h1>Assignments</h1>

<h2>L01: Intro to GENAI - Part 1</h2>
<p>I completed tutorials on ChatGPT, researched prompt engineering, and created a sample prompt using the CREATE framework.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> I learned how to get more specific and useful responses from AI by chunking topics and using simple language.</p>

<h2>L03: Infographic - Problem-Solving Concepts</h2>
<p>I created an infographic using Adobe Express to explain technical problem-solving with ChatGPT.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> I learned how to guide AI to generate visuals effectively for educational purposes.</p>

<h2>L04: Hardware Dissection Lab</h2>
<p>I researched the Nintendo Switch OLED, identified components like the CPU and motherboard, and presented it in PowerPoint with fun facts.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> I learned how small devices are still packed with complex hardware like I/O devices and internal chips.</p>

<h2>L06: Intro to GENAI - Part 2</h2>
<p>I used Copilot, ChatGPT, and Perplexity to generate troubleshooting guides using the CREATE framework.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> I saw how different AIs offer similar answers with different formatting styles depending on the tool.</p>

<h2>L06: Python Programming</h2>
<p>I used Grok Academy to practice basic Python skills like `input()` and `int()` for a rating system.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Python felt familiar due to my Java background, but I had to adjust to its syntax and indentation rules.</p>

<h2>L09: HTML</h2>
<p>I created a personal webpage using HTML with basic elements like headers, paragraphs, links, and images.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This was mostly review for me, since I’ve taken a full stack web development course before.</p>




<h1>Group Projects</h1>

<h2>L02: Virtual Info Treasure Hunt</h2>
<p>My group explored how hospitality workers use online reviews and info, using journals like the <em>International Journal of Hospitality Management</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> I improved at working with diverse classmates and using academic sources effectively.</p>

<h2>L08: OSINT Group Project</h2>
<p>I focused on Social Media Analysis—its techniques, use cases, and ethics. I revised content using ChatGPT for clarity.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> I learned leadership skills by assigning roles and communicating effectively in the group.</p>

<h2>L10: Phishing Infographic</h2>
<p>I worked on phishing research and created Canva graphics to match the content.</p>

<h2>L00: Intro & IT Interests</h2>
<p>I introduced myself and shared my interest in software engineering due to its demand across industries.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> I found relatable backgrounds with classmates, even in an online setting.</p>

<h2>L01: Group Collaboration</h2>
<p>I explained that I’m a visual learner and how understanding team roles improves collaboration.</p>
